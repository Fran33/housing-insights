Hey Housing Insights Team @ Code for DC!

Thanks to everyone that's been working to help get us prepared for our prototype design session tomorrow. Thomas, Joanne and John have been a huge help working on our user profiles, including meeting on Friday at CNHED to interview our project partner Scott Bruton. Meanwhile, Salomone has been hard at work on fleshing out our data dictionary. 

Tomorrow is the Code for DC hacknight, and I hope to see all of you there! We'll be using the information we've collected so far to draw sketches of what the tool design might look like. We'll have a few affordable housing professionals there to provide their perspective as well. Here's the [draft agenda](https://hackpad.com/Housing-Insights-qUpwNt38S75) for you to review.
