If you'd like to join for our third Prototype Design Session, here's the details:

I'll be providing some simple dinner food (Taylor's sandwiches). A computer probably won't be necessary, except for a quick look at some design inspiration. 

**Do before:**

- Take a look at the drawings we've done so far [on the Github website](https://github.com/codefordc/housing-insights/tree/dev/mockups/early-stage%20ideation)  

- Submit any additional drawings before tomorrow morning by adding them to [this Github issue](https://github.com/codefordc/housing-insights/issues/42).

**Meeting details:**
