A number of data sources come from the [opendata.dc.gov](http://opendata.dc.gov/) project. The OpenData project describes itself as a site where:

> ...the District of Columbia government shares hundreds of datasets. DC realizes that dataâ€™s greatest value comes from having it freely shared among agencies, federal and regional governments and with the public to the extent possible when considering safety, privacy and security.

Users are invited to analyze the available datasets and build apps using OpenData's APIs.
