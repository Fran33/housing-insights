- Install the Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface: `$ pip install awsebcli`
- Configure a profile that uses the AWS credentials for our Code for DC API account: `aws configure --profile codefordc`
- Enter the public and secret keys provided to you by an admin; default location and output format can be None (just press enter)



# Normal use:
1) Navigate to the housing-insights/python folder in your local repo
2) run `eb deploy housinginsights-codefordc --profile codefordc` (here housinginsights-codefordc is the elastic beanstalk environment name, and codefordc is the name of the credentials saved in your config file above)
3) Wait a few minutes while the server restarts w/ new code
4) Test that the api urls work properly, including whichever changes you've made. Visit http://housinginsights.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

# Deploy to staging enviroment to test
1) Navigate to housing-insights/python folder in your local repo
2) run `eb create --profile codefordc --instance_type t2.small --single`
3) At the prompt, enter the name housinginsights-staging
4) DNS CNAME can be default (i.e. housinginsights-staging)
5) Select classic load balancer type

This will both create and deploy the current code. Wait while the server starts up, and then test the api url to make sure your changes behave as expected
6) If you need to make any edits and deploy to a running test server, use: `eb deploy housinginsights-staging --profile codefordc`


7) **Important!** be sure to terminate the staging environment when you're done! You should only have this staging environment running while you're actively working on testing your live code. 

  Run `eb terminate housinginsights-staging`, or visit the Elastic Beanstalk instance in the web console (log in at https://codefordc.signin.aws.amazon.com/console). Note, be sure to include the name of the instance to terminate, since the default if none is specified is the production server. 

8) Use `eb list --profile codefordc` to verify that the instance has been terminated
